      <b>Video Functions in JES</b><br>
       <br>
      JES has the ability to create quicktime movies and play back lots of different movies.  To get playback to work, make sure that you have installed Quicktime for Java.  Instructions are on the <a href="1_Setting_up_JES.html">JES Installation</a> page.
      This is a list of functions that you may find useful when you are creating programs to manipulate or create videos in JES. Remember, these functions are part of a special library, and are not available in other Jython programming environments.
